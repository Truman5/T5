This page is the future home of an application game called "Cee-Lo".  This is a dice game of chance that has had a resurgence in popular culture, with roots from ancient times.

CEE-LO.com

For now the javascript is just a color changing action, but after learning more coding and database techniques, I will turn this into an interactive game.  Also maybe one day an app for the iphone.

Thank you for your time in reviewing my project.  Please submit questions or comments to Truman (502.930.1585)
